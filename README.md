this contains the data set used for the EDA and the notebook to refer the code.

the dataset - zomato csv, is downloaded from kaggle.

by analysing the data we've answered the following questions:
1. the type of resturant that receive the majority order from the customers.
2. how many votes has each type of resturant received from customers.
3. what are the ratings that the majority of the resturant have received.
4. Zomato has observed that most couple orders most of their food online. what is their average spending on their each order.
5. which mode (online/offline) has received the maximum rating.
6. which type of resturant received more offline orders, so that zomato can help customers with good offers to gain more online orders.
